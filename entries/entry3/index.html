                    In the forest's embrace, time finds repose, Where dappled light weaves secrets, nature bestows. A symphony of leaves, a whispered breeze, Relaxation blooms 'neath ancient trees.
The earthy scent, a balm for weary souls, Inhales the essence, makes the spirit whole. As moments linger, in nature's tender care, A dance with serenity, we're bound to share.
